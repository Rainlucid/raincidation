rd-characteristic-name-brawn = Brawn
rd-characteristic-description-brawn = Muscles are good. Especially when you have to crack a mutant's skull or pull your partner out of the rubble. But remember: in the Zone, even the toughest will crunch if he doesn't think with his head.
rd-characteristic-name-reflexes = Reflexes
rd-characteristic-description-reflexes = Bullets whistle, creatures leap out of the darkness, traps slam - the slow ones don't last long here. You either twitch in time or your bones are already being collected for souvenirs.
rd-characteristic-name-willpower = Willpower
rd-characteristic-description-willpower = The zone breaks. Some - at once, others - slowly, piece by piece. But if you don't give up, if you don't run screaming into the night, maybe you'll get out. Or at least die standing up.
rd-characteristic-name-intelligence = Intelligence
rd-characteristic-description-intelligence = This is no place for fools. You can't pick up artifacts, you can't get around anomalies, you can't get rations if you're not smart enough. But smart guys don't last long, either. They think too much.
rd-characteristic-name-leadership = Leadership
rd-characteristic-description-leadership = Alone in the Zone is a dead man. But leading others is even more dangerous. Some will betray, some will die, some will go mad. But if you're lucky, maybe you can lead them to their goal. Or death.
rd-characteristic-name-luck = Luck
rd-characteristic-description-luck = It's all a matter of chance. The bullet will fly by, the artifact will end up in a piece of rusty metal, the ejection will go sideways. But luck is a fickle thing. One day you're lucky, the next day you're just another dead man.
rd-characteristic-name-skill-melee = Melee Combat
rd-characteristic-description-skill-melee = When the bullets run out and the beasts are too close — fists, knives, and pipes become your best friends. It's not elegant, but it keeps you alive. If you can swing faster than they bite.
rd-characteristic-name-skill-range-light = Light Firearms
rd-characteristic-description-skill-range-light = Pistols, SMGs — fast, light, easy to carry. Not much stopping power, but enough to put something down if you know where to shoot. Precision and speed make the difference.
rd-characteristic-name-skill-range-medium = Medium Firearms
rd-characteristic-description-skill-range-medium = Rifles, shotguns — your mainstay in the Zone. Reliable tools for when things go loud. But remember: ammo is heavy, and the recoil is no joke if your hands are shaking.
rd-characteristic-name-skill-range-hight = Heavy Firearms
rd-characteristic-description-skill-range-hight = Machine guns, grenade launchers, anti-materiel weapons — overkill by any other name. But when the Zone throws giants at you, sometimes you need something that makes a crater.
rd-characteristic-name-skill-craft = Crafting
rd-characteristic-description-skill-craft = Duct tape, rusted screws, and sheer will. You don’t find gear in perfect condition here — you make it, fix it, or improvise it. Those who can't build, break.
rd-characteristic-name-skill-cook = Cooking
rd-characteristic-description-skill-cook = You can't eat bullets. Sooner or later you'll need a fire, a pot, and something not glowing green. A good meal keeps the mind sane and the hands steady. Poison yourself, and you'll feed the Zone.
rd-characteristic-name-skill-medicine = Medicine
rd-characteristic-description-skill-medicine = Out here, a scratch can kill and a bullet wound is a coin toss. Knowing how to stop bleeding, set bones, and fight infection isn’t a luxury — it’s survival. If your hands don’t shake and your heart doesn’t turn at the sight of guts, maybe you’ll keep someone alive. Maybe even yourself.
